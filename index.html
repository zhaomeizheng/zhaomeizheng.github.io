<h1>Hi!</h1>
 <p>I'm Mei, and I'll be sharing my interests here, both academic and non-academic pursuits.</p>

<h2>A little bit about myself.</h2>
 <p>I'm currently a fourth year university student completing my Honours in Applied Mathematics at the University of Sydney. I've majored in Mathematics and Immunobiology and I'm highly interested in understanding and modelling infectious disease spread within a community. I'm particularly interested in diseases vectored by mosquitoes as well as contagious air-borne diseases such as highly mutable viral strains of influenza and the recent coronavirus (COVID-19). </p>
 <h2>University coursework. </h2>
